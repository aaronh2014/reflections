When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Backup!  Working in different locations, on different comptuers, in different environments!  
  Testing purposes: Working in different environments seems like the bare minimum for testing compatability.
  Collaboration!
  Contribution to the wider community, feedback.
