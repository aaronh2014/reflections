When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Backup!  Working in different locations, on different comptuers, in different environments!  
  Testing purposes: Working in different environments seems like the bare minimum for testing compatability.
  Collaboration!
  Contribution to the wider community, feedback.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 So that you are in control of your development cycle and can choose when to deal with updates.  I'd definitely like to streamline this process though:
 git add foo.bar
 git commit -m "Modify foo.bar"
 git push (on Windows) or git push origin master...enter credentials every single time?  How about I just use a lock screen on my computer?
